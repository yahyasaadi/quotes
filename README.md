# Quotes Apps

This project was published on 08-01-2022
This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 13.0.4.

## Description

This is a web application where users can create quote and have those quotes vote on whether they are terrible or are inspirational. When users are creating a quote, they also provide who said the quote and the user will also provide his/her name. If a user does not like a quote he has the option to delete that specific quote.

## Technologies Used

- HTML & CSS
- TypeScrip

## Known Bugs
No known bags at the moment. There are some functionality that I want to add to the project with time like:
- How long ago a quote was created.
- Quote with the most upvotes.
